            Hello, my name is Josh and I'm a Front-End Developer from Fort
            Collins, Colorado. I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in Graphic
            Design in 2014. I grew up in Southern California and in 2019 I moved
            to Camp Hill, Pennsylvania where I started working at Listrak. In
            August of 2020, I moved out to Fort Collins, Colorado to be a full
            time remote employee for Listrak. Currently, I build responsive user
            acquisition tools with cross-browser compatibility for a retail
            digital marketing automation platform offering email marketing,
            on-site engagement, text messaging, customer insights, and
            cross-channel orchestration. I work with the design team to build
            mock-ups using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also monitor
            client website performance to help with front-end issues.Â I partner
            with design team, project managers, and tech staff to ensure on-time
            delivery and effective alignment with process standards.
            <br />
            <br />I started my career as a Graphic Designer and that has given
            me the skills to both design and build UI for web and mobile. I have
            significant experience in cross-browser compatibility, tool
            development, mock-ups, graphic design, and project management from
            concept through delivery. I effectively collaborate with marketing,
            project, and content teams to meet process standards and deadlines
            while help building client relationships through communication,
            problem solving, and&nbsp;engagement.
            <br />
